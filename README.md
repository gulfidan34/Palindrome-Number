# Palindrome-Number
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        copy = x
        reverse_number = 0
        while copy >0:
            last_digit = copy % 10
            reverse_number = (reverse_number * 10)  + last_digit
            copy = copy // 10
        return x == reverse_number
